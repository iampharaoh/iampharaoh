        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I AM PHARAOH is a dynamic solo music project based in Chicago, showcasing the talents of the multi-instrumentalist, PHARAOH. From an early age, PHARAOH was enthralled by the captivating power of music. Her developmental milestones, including walking and talking, were accompanied by tunes like Meatloaf's "I Won't Do That," They Might Be Giants' "Istanbul (Not Constantinople)," and the entire repertoire of Raffi. At the age of three, PHARAOH began her musical journey with violin and piano lessons. Influenced by iconic characters such as Lisa Simpson from "The Simpsons" and Tiny Kong from "Donkey Kong 64," she chose to learn the alto saxophone in her elementary school band, and soon after, transitioned to playing the tenor saxophone. PHARAOH's songwriting career took off during her middle school years, inspired by the haunting melodies of "Helena" by My Chemical Romance and an accidental birthday gift of Good Charlotte's "The Chronicles of Life and Death." She began to fill notebooks with lyrics and pursued guitar and drum lessons. Her high school years were marked by a rich involvement in music, playing tenor sax, trumpet, and percussion in marching band, jazz band, and concert band. In college, she expanded her musical repertoire by taking vocal lessons and joining the choir. Though PHARAOH draws heavy inspiration from the 2000s pop punk and emo era, she continues to experiment with a wide range of musical genres, embracing the limitless nature of music.</p>
